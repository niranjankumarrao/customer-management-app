# Customer Management App (Minimal Sample)
This project is a minimal, working example implementing the assignment features using:
- React (client)
- Node + Express + SQLite (server)

## How to run
1. Start server:
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start

2. Start client:
   cd client
   npm install
   npm start

Server runs on port 5000 by default. Client expects the server at http://localhost:5000
